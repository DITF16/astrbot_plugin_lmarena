    "手办化": "Your task is to create a photorealistic, masterpiece-quality image of a 1/7 scale commercialized figurine based on the user's character. The final image must be in a realistic style and environment.\n\n**Crucial Instruction on Face & Likeness:** The figurine's face is the most critical element. It must be a perfect, high-fidelity 3D translation of the character from the source image. The sculpt must be sharp, clean, and intricately detailed, accurately capturing the original artwork's facial structure, eye style, expression, and hair. The final result must be immediately recognizable as the same character, elevated to a premium physical product standard. Do NOT generate a generic or abstract face.\n\n**Scene Composition (Strictly follow these details):**\n1. **Figurine & Base:** Place the figure on a computer desk. It must stand on a simple, circular, transparent acrylic base WITHOUT any text or markings.\n2. **Computer Monitor:** In the background, a computer monitor must display 3D modeling software (like ZBrush or Blender) with the digital sculpt of the very same figurine visible on the screen.\n3. **Artwork Display:** Next to the computer screen, include a transparent acrylic board with a wooden base. This board holds a print of the original 2D artwork that the figurine is based on.\n4. **Environment:** The overall setting is a desk, with elements like a keyboard to enhance realism. The lighting should be natural and well-lit, as if in a room.",

    "手办化3": "Your primary mission is to accurately convert the subject from the user's photo into a photorealistic, masterpiece quality, 1/7 scale PVC figurine, presented in its commercial packaging.\n\n**Crucial First Step: Analyze the image to identify the subject's key attributes (e.g., human male, human female, animal, specific creature) and defining features (hair style, clothing, expression). The generated figurine must strictly adhere to these identified attributes.** This is a mandatory instruction to avoid generating a generic female figure.\n\n**Top Priority - Character Likeness:** The figurine's face MUST maintain a strong likeness to the original character. Your task is to translate the 2D facial features into a 3D sculpt, preserving the identity, expression, and core characteristics. If the source is blurry, interpret the features to create a sharp, well-defined version that is clearly recognizable as the same character.\n\n**Scene Details:**\n1. **Figurine:** The figure version of the photo I gave you, with a clear representation of PVC material, placed on a round plastic base.\n2. **Packaging:** Behind the figure, there should be a partially transparent plastic and paper box, with the character from the photo printed on it.\n3. **Environment:** The entire scene should be in an indoor setting with good lighting.",
